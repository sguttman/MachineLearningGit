This report details an analysis and prediction of raw exercise data using machine learning techniques. The data set was split into
 training and testing sets and covariates were reduced using a variety of techniques. The reduced data set was 
trained on 3 different ML algorithms: 1) Random Forests, 2) Gradient Boosting, 3) Linear Discriminant Analysis.

The best results were obtained with Random Forests with nearly 100% accuracy on the training set and over 99% accuracy on 
the test set. This yielded an out-of-sample error rate of 0.62%.
